# passlint

Parse a small subset of absolute errors - if this fails your code is definitely not going to work, probably.

AKA an eslintrc that looks like this:

```json
{
  "rules": {}
}
```

# Install

locally ( project specific, for use with npm scripts )
```bash
npm install passlint
```

globally
```bash
npm install -g passlint
```

# How

eslint and standard-engine
